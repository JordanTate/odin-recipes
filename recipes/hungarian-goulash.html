                <li>½ Teaspoon of Caraway Seeds</li>
                <li>2 Tablespoons of Vegatable Oil</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon of Butter</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon of Plain Flour</li>

            </ul>
            <br />
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the fan oven to 200°C (392°F)</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix diced Onions, Peppers, Garlic, 1 Tablespoon of Vegatable Oil, 1 Teaspoon of Paprika, 1 Teaspoon of Oregano, and a sprinkle of both Salt and Pepper. Transfer vegatables onto a baking tray and roast in the over for 15 to 20 Minutes.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, combine diced Beef with 1 Tablespoon of Vegatable Oil and divide it into two parts. Sear each batch on high heat in a frying pan to brown the meat. Once ready, transfer into a medium-sized pot. Add a splash of Red Wine to deglaze the frying pan and transfer it to the main pot.</li>
                <li>Add your roasted vegatables plus the sliced Carrots into the pot with the meat, cover with Beef Stock and season with 1 Teaspoon of Smoked Paprika and 1 Teaspoon of Marjoram. Bring to boil and reduce to simmer, cover the pot with a lid and cook until the meat is nice and tender (1 to 2 Hours depending on the cut of Beef used).</li>
                <li>When ready, take off the lid, add Chopped Tomatoes and adjust the seasoning with Salt and Black Pepper.</li>
                <li>In a small pan, melt 1 Tablespoon of Butter and combine with 1 Tablespoon of Plain Flour. Stir the roux into the Goulash to thicken.</li>
                <li>Serve with toasted Sourdough Bread and garnish with freshly chopped Parsley. Add Chilli for some kick or Soured Cream to break the flavours. Also delicious to serve over Pasta or Boiled Potatoes.</li>
