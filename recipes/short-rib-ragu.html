            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3>Cook the Pancetta</h3>
                <li>Place the Diced Pancetta in a large pot. On Medium Heat, stir occasionally for 4 to 5 Minutes of until the fat renders and the Pancetta browns. Remove from pot and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
                <h3>Brown the Short Ribs</h3>
                <li>Pat the Short Ribs dry and season with Salt and Pepper. Place the Short Ribs in the Pancetta fat and cook over a medium-high heat for 3 to 5 Minutes per side until browned all over. Transfer to the bowl with the Pancetta.</li>
                <li>Add the Sausage and Beef. Cook for around 15 Minutes until browned, breaking the meat apart with a spoon. Season with Salt and Pepper and transfer to the bowl of Pancetta and Short Ribs.</li>
                <h3>Cook the Aromatics</h3>
                <li>If needed, add another teaspoon or two of Oil, and turn the heat to medium-high.</li>
                <li>Add Onion, Celery, and Carrots, cooking for 5 to 7 Minutes. Season the vegatables with Salt and Pepper.</li>
                <h3>Brown the Tomato Paste</h3>
                <li>Melt the Butter into the Onions. Add the Garlic and cook for 45 Seconds. Add the Tomato Paste and cook, mashing it into the aromatics for 2 Minutes until it begins to deepen in colour. Be careful not to burn the Garlic.</li>
                <li>Pour in the Red Wine and turn the heat to high. Whisk the wine into the paste and continue until the wine begins to boil. Boil for 5 Minutes until it just starts to reduce.</li>
                <h3>Simmer the Ragu</h3>
                <li>Add the Tomatoes and bring to a boil. Stir in all of the meat from the bowl. Season the sauce with Salt, Pepper, Sugar and Crushed Red Pepper. Add the Bay Leaves.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 3 to 4 Hours or until the Short Ribs can be shredded easily with a fork.</li>
                <h3>Shred the Short Ribs</h3>
                <li>Remove the Ragu from the heat and carefully remove the lid. Shred the Beef and mash any remaining whole-peeled tomatoes. Turn the heat to medium-high and let the Ragu low-boil uncovered for 15 to 20 Minutes. If the liquid evaporates too quickly, add Beef Stock in ¼ Cup increments. Taste and season the sauce.</li>
                <h3>Cook the Pasta</h3>
                <li>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the Pasta and cook according to package instructions. Reserve Half a Cup of the water and then drain the Pasta.</li>
                <h3>Coat the Pasta</h3>
                <li>Return the heat on the Ragy to medium. Once bubbling, add the reserved water along with the cooked Pasta. Toss to coat for 1 to 2 Minutes. Taste and season once more to your preferences.</li>
                <h3>To Serve</h3>
                <li>Divide the Pasta between bowls and garnish with Parsley and Grated Parmesan Cheese.</li>
